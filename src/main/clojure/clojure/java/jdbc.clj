    :doc "A Clojure interface to SQL databases via JDBC

clojure.java.jdbc provides a simple abstraction for CRUD (create, read,
update, delete) operations on a SQL database, along with basic transaction
support. Basic DDL operations are also supported (create table, drop table,
access to table metadata).

Maps are used to represent records, making it easy to store and retrieve
data. Results can be processed using any standard sequence operations.

For most operations, Java's PreparedStatement is used so your SQL and
parameters can be represented as simple vectors where the first element
is the SQL string, with ? for each parameter, and the remaining elements
are the parameter values to be substituted. In general, operations return
the number of rows affected, except for a single record insert where any
generated keys are returned (as a map).

As of release 0.3.0, the API has undergone a major overhaul and most of the
original API has been deprecated in favor of a more idiomatic API, and a
minimal DSL for generating SQL has been added as an option. The original
API is still supported but will be deprecated before a 1.0.0 release is
made at some future date." }
