clojure.java.jdbc
========================================

A low-level Clojure wrapper for JDBC-based access to databases. This project is "Stable" (no longer "Active"). It has effectively been superseded by [seancorfield/next.jdbc](https://github.com/seancorfield/next-jdbc).

For higher level DSLs and migration libraries that are compatible, see the [documentation](http://clojure-doc.org/articles/ecosystem/java_jdbc/home.html).

Formerly known as `clojure.contrib.sql`.

This library is mature and stable. It is widely used and its use is described in many books and tutorials. It will continue to get bug fixes and minor releases. Based on my experience using and maintaining this library, I've created a faster, more modern JDBC wrapper called [next.jdbc](https://github.com/seancorfield/next-jdbc). I consider it to be the "next generation" of `clojure.java.jdbc` but it exposes a different API -- a better API, I think.

Note: different versions of various database drivers have different Java/JVM version requirements. In particular, recent versions of Apache Derby require at least Java 8 and recent versions of H2 require at least Java 7. Clojure's Continuous Integration system uses older versions so tests can be run on Java 6 (see `pom.xml`); local testing is done with more recent versions on Java 8.

Example Usage
========================================
```clojure
(require '[clojure.java.jdbc :as j])

;; there are many ways to write a db-spec but the easiest way is to
;; use :dbtype and then provide the :dbname and any of :user, :password,
;; :host, :port, and other options as needed:
(def mysql-db {:dbtype "mysql"
               :dbname "clojure_test"
               :user "clojure_test"
               :password "clojure_test"})

(def pg-db {:dbtype "postgresql"
            :dbname "mypgdatabase"
            :host "mydb.server.com"
            :user "myuser"
            :password "secret"
            :ssl true
            :sslfactory "org.postgresql.ssl.NonValidatingFactory"})

;; if the dbtype is not known to clojure.java.jdbc, or you want to override the
;; default choice of JDBC driver class name, you can provide :classname and the
;; name of the class to use:

(def redshift42 {:dbtype "redshift"
                 :dbname "myredstore"
                 :classname "com.amazon.redshift.jdbc42.Driver"
                 ...})

;; you can also specify a full connection string if you'd prefer:
(def pg-uri
  {:connection-uri (str "postgresql://myuser:secret@mydb.server.com:5432/mypgdatabase"
                        "?ssl=true&sslfactory=org.postgresql.ssl.NonValidatingFactory")})

(j/insert-multi! mysql-db :fruit
  [{:name "Apple" :appearance "rosy" :cost 24}
   {:name "Orange" :appearance "round" :cost 49}])
;; ({:generated_key 1} {:generated_key 2})

(j/query mysql-db
  ["select * from fruit where appearance = ?" "rosy"]
  {:row-fn :cost})
;; (24)
```

Developer Information
========================================

* [GitHub project](https://github.com/clojure/java.jdbc)

* [Bug Tracker](http://clojure.atlassian.net/browse/JDBC)

* [Continuous Integration](http://build.clojure.org/job/java.jdbc/)

* [Compatibility Test Matrix](http://build.clojure.org/job/java.jdbc-test-matrix/)

* Testing:
  * Currently by default tests run only against Derby and HSQLDB, the in-process databases.

* To test against PostgreSQL, first create the user and database:

        $ sudo -u postgres createuser clojure_test -P clojure_test
        $ sudo -u postgres createdb clojure_test -O clojure_test

* Or similarly with MySQL:

        $ mysql -u root
        mysql> create database clojure_test;
        mysql> grant all on clojure_test.* to clojure_test identified by "clojure_test";

* Then run the tests with the <tt>TEST_DBS</tt> environment variable:

        $ TEST_DBS="mysql postgres" mvn test

* Also see the `run-tests.sh` shell script which uses the `clj` CLI and `deps.edn` for multi-version testing!

Change Log
====================

* Release 0.7.11 on 2019-12-24
  * Address edge case in transaction rollback failure [JDBC-179](https://clojure.atlassian.net/browse/JDBC-179).

* Release 0.7.10 on 2019-08-24
  * Use a US-locale `lower-case` function to avoid problems in certain locales (e.g., Turkish). A similar issue has been fixed recently in both HoneySQL and `next.jdbc`.
  * Clean up `db-spec` options that are passed to the JDBC connection manager as properties [JDBC-178](https://clojure.atlassian.net/browse/JDBC-178).
  * Relax restriction on `create-table-ddl` column specs to allow numbers (as well as keywords and strings) [JDBC-177](https://clojure.atlassian.net/browse/JDBC-177).

* Release 0.7.9 on 2019-02-21
  * Fix behavior of multi-inserts when database does not support generated keys [JDBC-176](https://clojure.atlassian.net/browse/JDBC-176).
  * Added _highly experimental_ support for `datafy`/`nav` (in `clojure.java.jdbc.datafy` namespace). This includes a convention-based approach to foreign keys with some assistance from a `:schema` option. This is subject to change and is provided mostly for informational purposes, as an example of the new functionality in Clojure 1.10. This includes a fix for the conventions from [JDBC-175](https://clojure.atlassian.net/browse/JDBC-175).
  * Add note about rewriting batched operations to `insert-multi!` for some drivers [JDBC-174](https://clojure.atlassian.net/browse/JDBC-174).
  * Support Oracle SID style URLs (`dbtype` can be `oracle:sid` which maps to `oracle:thin` and uses `:` as the separator before the `dbname` value) [JDBC-173](https://clojure.atlassian.net/browse/JDBC-173).

* Release 0.7.8 on 2018-08-13
  * Support multiple JDBC driver class names (MySQL introduced a new driver class name with its 6.x connector) [JDBC-172](https://clojure.atlassian.net/browse/JDBC-172).
  * Allow `with-db-connection` and `with-db-metadata` to nest [JDBC-171](https://clojure.atlassian.net/browse/JDBC-171).

* Release 0.7.7 on 2018-06-23
  * Support `:as-arrays?`, `:result-set-fn`, and `:row-fn` in operations that return generated keys as a result set (`execute!`, `insert!`, and `insert-multi!`) [JDBC-169](https://clojure.atlassian.net/browse/JDBC-169).
  * `get-connection` provides much better feedback if you accidentally call a function that expects a `db-spec` but pass a `java.sql.Connection` object instead (which is only required for `prepare-statement`).

* Release 0.7.6 on 2018-04-24
  * `execute!` now supports `:return-keys` as a vector of column names, rather than just a simple Boolean value, for drivers that support that [JDBC-166](https://clojure.atlassian.net/browse/JDBC-166).
  * Add built-in support for H2 in-memory database (`:dbtype "h2:mem"`).
  * Add missing spec for `db-spec` being a `java.net.URI` object.
  * Fix `add-connection` handling of string `db-spec` (becomes `:connection-uri`, not `:connection-string`).
  * Fix specs for `with-db-*` functions, to support options in the binding form [JDBC-165](https://clojure.atlassian.net/browse/JDBC-165).
  * Update tests so they work properly with string `db-spec` test databases.
  * Ensure no reflection warnings are present.
  * Switched local test infrastructure over to CLI and `deps.edn` (from Leiningen) as an example of multi-version testing without a "build tool".

* Release 0.7.5 on 2017-12-29
  * Add support for `:return-keys` in `execute!` and `:multi?` in `db-do-prepared-return-keys` [JDBC-163](https://clojure.atlassian.net/browse/JDBC-163).

* Release 0.7.4 on 2017-12-14
  * Improved discoverability of other `java.jdbc` documentation [JDBC-160](https://clojure.atlassian.net/browse/JDBC-160).
  * Optional specs updated with `:keywordize?` and `:connection-uri` changes from 0.7.2 and 0.7.3 releases.
  * Performance improvements, primarily in `query` and `reducible-query`.
  * Experimental `:raw?` result set handling in `reducible-query`.
  * `modify-connection` is more robust in the face of `null` connections and bad option values.

* Release 0.7.3 on 2017-10-05
  * Added `:keywordize?` option alongside `:identifiers` that defaults to `true` but can be set to `false` to opt-out of converting identifiers to keywords (so column names etc will only be processed by the function passed as `:identifiers`) [JDBC-159](https://clojure.atlassian.net/browse/JDBC-159).
  * If an exception occurs during a transaction, and then rollback fails with another exception, both exceptions will now be combined into an `ex-info`. Previously the rollback exception obscured the transaction exception [JDBC-158](https://clojure.atlassian.net/browse/JDBC-158).

* Release 0.7.2 on 2017-10-02
  * `connection-uri` was incorrectly spec'd as a `java.net.URI` but should be `string?` [JDBC-156](https://clojure.atlassian.net/browse/JDBC-156).
  * Allow for `:user` and `:password` to be passed with `:connection-uri`, so credentials can be omitted from the connection string.
  * Clarified docstring for `get-connection` to show where `:user` and `:password` can be passed.

* Release 0.7.1 on 2017-08-30
  * Connection strings with empty values were not parsed correctly [JDBC-155](https://clojure.atlassian.net/browse/JDBC-155).

* Release 0.7.0 on 2017-07-16
  * `:conditional?` option for `create-table-ddl` and `drop-table-ddl` to provide for existence check (or a function to manipulate the generated DDL).
  * Add better support for Oracle connections (default port to `1521`, support `:dbtype "oracle"` -- as `"oracle:thin"` -- and `:dbtype "oracle:oci"`, with `@` instead of `//` before host).

* Release 0.7.0-beta5 on 2017-07-05
  * `get-connection` now accepts an `opts` map with `:auto-commit?` and `:read-only?` options. If present, the appropriate methods will be called on the connection obtained. These options are valid in any function call that may call `get-connection` under the hood. This should allow for streaming results in a query for most databases [JDBC-153](https://clojure.atlassian.net/browse/JDBC-153).
  * Additional validation of options is performed in `prepared-statement` to avoid silently ignoring invalid combinations of `:concurrency`, `:cursors`, `:result-type`, and `:return-keys`.

* Release 0.7.0-beta4 on 2017-07-04
  * `opts` are now correctly passed from `reducible-query` to `db-query-with-resultset`.
  * Updated the `::query-options` spec to make it clear that `::prepare-options` are also acceptable there.

* Release 0.7.0-beta3 on 2017-07-04
  * Reflection warnings removed in `reducible-result-set` [JDBC-152](https://clojure.atlassian.net/browse/JDBC-152).

* Release 0.7.0-beta2 on 2017-06-30 (a.k.a The Reducible Saga, Part 2)
  * Support for Clojure 1.5 and 1.6 has been dropped -- breaking change.
  * Or, put another way, `clojure.java.jdbc` now requires Clojure 1.7 or later!
  * All public functions now have specs in the optional `clojure.java.jdbc.spec` namespace (requires `clojure.spec.alpha`).
  * `reducible-query` and `reducible-result-set` use `IReduce` and correctly support the no-`init` arity of `reduce` by using the first row of the `ResultSet`, if present, as the (missing) `init` value, and only calling `f` with no arguments if the `ResultSet` is empty. The `init` arity of `reduce` only ever calls `f` with two arguments.

* Release 0.7.0-beta1 on 2017-06-29
  * Support for Clojure 1.4.0 has been dropped -- breaking change.
  * Optional spec support now uses `clojure.spec.alpha`.
  * `reducible-query` accepts a `db-spec` and a SQL/parameters vector and returns a reducible (`IReduce` on Clojure 1.7 or later; `CollReduce` on Clojure 1.5/1.6): when reduced, it runs the query, obtains a reducible result set, and then reduces that. A reducible query will run the query each time it is reduced. The helper function `reducible-result-set` is public: it accepts a `ResultSet` and produces a reducible that offers a single pass reduce over the rows. Both functions honor `reduced` values to short-circuit the process [JDBC-99](https://clojure.atlassian.net/browse/JDBC-99).

* Release 0.7.0-alpha3 on 2017-03-23
  * `classname` is now accepted with `dbtype` / `dbname` so you can easily specify a JDBC driver class name for a database type that is not known [JDBC-151](http://clojure.atlassian.net/browse/JDBC-151).
  * `redshift` has been added as a `dbtype` with `com.amazon.redshift.jdbc.Driver` as the driver name.

* Release 0.7.0-alpha2 on 2017-03-01
  * `pgsql` and the Impossibl PostgresSQL 'NG' driver are now supported (note that `:max-rows` does not work with this driver!); also, providing unknown `dbtype` or `subprotocol` in a `db-spec` should now throw a better exception [JDBC-150](http://clojure.atlassian.net/browse/JDBC-150).
  * `quoted` now accepts keywords for database / dialect (`:ansi` (including PostgresSQL), `:mysql`, `:oracle`, `:sqlserver` -- these match the keywords used in HoneySQL which is the recommended third party SQL DSL for java.jdbc) [JDBC-149](http://clojure.atlassian.net/browse/JDBC-149).
  * Reorder `get-connection` clauses to make it easier to combine keys in a `db-spec` [JDBC-148](http://clojure.atlassian.net/browse/JDBC-148).
  * Force load `DriverManager` before `classForName` call on drivers to avoid potential race condition on initialization [JDBC-145](http://clojure.atlassian.net/browse/JDBC-145).

* Release 0.7.0-alpha1 on 2016-11-12 -- potentially breaking changes
  * The signatures of `as-sql-name` and `quoted` have changed slightly: the former no longer has the curried (single argument) version, and the latter no longer has the two argument version. This change came out of a discussion on Slack which indicated curried functions are non-idiomatic. If you relied on the curried version of `as-sql-name`, you will not need to use `partial`. If you relied on the two argument version of `quoted`, you will need to add an extra `( )` for the one argument call. I'd be fairly surprised if anyone is using `as-sql-name` at all since it is really an implementation detail. I'd also be surprised if anyone was using the two argument version of `quoted` since the natural usage is `:entities (quoted [\[ \]])` to create a naming strategy (that provides SQL entity quoting).
  * Clarified that `insert-multi!` with a sequence of row maps may be substantially slower than with a sequence of row value vectors (the former performs an insert for each row, the latter performs a single insert for all the data together) [JDBC-147](http://clojure.atlassian.net/browse/JDBC-147).
  * All options are passed through all function calls, expanding the range of options you can pass into high-level functions such as `insert!` and `update!` [JDBC-144](http://clojure.atlassian.net/browse/JDBC-144).
  * Added `get-isolation-level` to return the current transaction's isolation level, if any [JDBC-141](http://clojure.atlassian.net/browse/JDBC-141).
  * Added support for `read-columns` option to allow more flexible customization of reading column values from a result set (particularly in a multi-database application). Also expands `set-parameters` support to options (previously it was just part of the db-spec) [JDBC-137](http://clojure.atlassian.net/browse/JDBC-137).
  * Expanded optional `clojure.spec` coverage to almost the whole library API.

* Release 0.6.2-alpha3 on 2016-08-25
  * Fixed bad interaction between `:qualifier` and existing `:identifiers` functionality [JDBC-140](http://clojure.atlassian.net/browse/JDBC-140).
  * Updated the README and docstrings to reflect that `:dbtype` is the easiest / preferred way to write `db-spec` maps [JDBC-139](http://clojure.atlassian.net/browse/JDBC-139).
  * Fixed postgres / postgresql alias support [JDBC-138](http://clojure.atlassian.net/browse/JDBC-138).
    This also adds aliases for mssql (sqlserver), jtds (jtds:sqlserver), oracle (oracle:thin), and hsql (hsqldb).

* Release 0.6.2-alpha2 on 2016-07-21
  * Update `clojure.spec` support to work with Clojure 1.9.0 Alpha 10.

* Release 0.6.2-alpha1 on 2016-07-05
  * Experimental support for `clojure.spec` via the new `clojure.java.jdbc.spec` namespace. Requires Clojure 1.9.0 Alpha 8 (or later).
  * All options to all functions can now have defaults within the `db-spec` itself [JDBC-136](http://clojure.atlassian.net/browse/JDBC-136).
  * `query` (and by extension `find-by-keys` and `get-by-id`) now support `:explain?` and `:explain-fn` options to help support basic performance analysis [JDBC-135](http://clojure.atlassian.net/browse/JDBC-135).
  * `insert!` and `insert-multi!` now respect `:identifiers` and `:qualifier` because inserting rows on PostgreSQL returns full rows, not just the newly inserted keys [JDBC-134](http://clojure.atlassian.net/browse/JDBC-134).
  * In addition to the `:identifiers` option, you can now use `:qualifier` to specify a namespace qualifier (string) to be used when constructing keywords from SQL column names [JDBC-133](http://clojure.atlassian.net/browse/JDBC-133).

* Release 0.6.1 on 2016-05-12 -- **IMPORTANT BUG FIX!**
  * `insert!` and `insert-multi!` now default `:transaction?` to `true` (as they should have done in 0.6.0!) [JDBC-128](http://clojure.atlassian.net/browse/JDBC-128). These two functions also have improved docstrings to clarify the difference in behavior between inserting rows as maps compared to inserting rows as a series of column values.
  * PostgreSQL support has been improved: java.jdbc is now tested against PostgreSQL locally (as well as SQLite, Apache Derby, HSQLDB, H2, MySQL, MS SQL Server (both MS Type 4 driver and jTDS driver). [JDBC-127](http://clojure.atlassian.net/browse/JDBC-127) and [JDBC-129](http://clojure.atlassian.net/browse/JDBC-129).


* Release 0.6.0 on 2016-05-11 -- **BREAKING RELEASE! DEPRECATED FUNCTIONALITY REMOVED!**
  * `find-by-keys` now correctly handles `nil` values [JDBC-126](http://clojure.atlassian.net/browse/JDBC-126). 0.6.0 / 2016-05-11.
  * `find-by-keys` calls `seq` on `:order-by` to treat `[]` as no `ORDER BY` clause. 0.6.0 / 2016-05-11.
  * `db-query-with-resultset` now accepts an options map and passes it to `prepare-statement` [JDBC-125](http://clojure.atlassian.net/browse/JDBC-125). 0.6.0-rc2 / 2016-05-07.
    - Passing the `prepare-statement` options map as the first element of the `[sql & params]` vector is no longer supported and will throw an `IllegalArgumentException`. It was always very poorly documented and almost never used, as far as I can tell.
  * `db-query-with-resultset` no longer requires the `sql-params` argument to be a vector: a sequence is acceptable. This is in line with other functions that accept a sequence. 0.6.0-rc2 / 2016-05-07.
  * `db-query-with-resultset` now accepts a bare SQL string or `PreparedStatement` as the `sql-params` argument, when there are no parameters needed. This is in line with other functions that accept SQL or a `PreparedStatement`. 0.6.0-rc2 / 2016-05-07.
  * `query`'s options map now is passed to `db-query-with-resultset` and thus can contain options to be used to construct the `PreparedStatement` [JDBC-125](http://clojure.atlassian.net/browse/JDBC-125). 0.6.0-rc2 / 2016-05-07.
  * Adds `get-by-id` and `find-by-keys` convenience functions (these were easy to add after the API changes in 0.6.0 and we rely very heavily on them at World Singles so putting them in the core for everyone seemed reasonable). 0.6.0-rc1 / 2016-05-04.
    - `find-by-keys` accepts an `:order-by` option that expects a sequence of orderings; an ordering is a column name (keyword) or a map from column name (keyword) to direction (`:asc` or `:desc`). 0.6.0-rc2 / 2016-05-07.
  * Ensures SQL / params are actually vectors prior to destructuring (this addresses an interop edge case from other languages) [JDBC-124](http://clojure.atlassian.net/browse/JDBC-124). 0.6.0-alpha2 / 2016-04-18.
  * Fix typo in `insert-multi!` argument validation exception [JDBC-123](http://clojure.atlassian.net/browse/JDBC-123). 0.6.0-alpha2 / 2016-04-18.
  * ALL DEPRECATED FUNCTIONALITY HAS BEEN REMOVED! [JDBC-118](http://clojure.atlassian.net/browse/JDBC-118). 0.6.0-alpha1 / 2016-04-13
    - See changes described in versions 0.5.5 through 0.5.8 for what was deprecated
    - Use version 0.5.8 as a bridge to identify any deprecated API calls on which your code relies!
    - `db-transaction` (deprecated in version 0.3.0) has been removed
    - The `java.jdbc.deprecated` namespace has been removed

* Release 0.5.8 on 2016-04-12
  * `db-do-commands` now expects multiple commands to be be wrapped in a vector [JDBC-122](http://clojure.atlassian.net/browse/JDBC-123). The single command form is unchanged (but may be wrapped in a vector). Calling `db-do-commands` with multiple commands (not wrapped in a single vector) will produce a "DEPRECATED" warning printed to the console.
  * `db-do-prepared` and `db-do-prepared-return-keys` now expect to receive a `db-spec`, an optional `transaction?` boolean, a `sql-params` argument, and an optional options map. `sql-params` is a vector containing a SQL string or `PreparedStatement` followed by parameters -- like other APIs in this library. In addition, like the `:multi? true` version of `execute!`, `db-do-prepared` can accept a vector that has parameter groups: multiple vectors containing groups of parameter values [JDBC-122](http://clojure.atlassian.net/browse/JDBC-123). Calling `db-do-prepared` with unrolled arguments -- the SQL string / statement followed by parameter groups -- is deprecated and will produce "DEPRECATED" warnings printed to the console.

* Release 0.5.7 on 2016-04-10
  * `(insert! db table [:col] ["val"] {})` syntax, introduced in 0.5.6, threw an exception [JDBC-121](http://clojure.atlassian.net/browse/JDBC-121).
